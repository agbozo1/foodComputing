# foodComputing
A study by colleague Maija Kale (University of Latvia) & Ebenezer Agbozo (Ural Federal University) on Complexity of food consumption: deconstructing recipes.
This algorithm is the basis for our presentation at the *14th International Symposium of Cognition, Logic and Communication
"Linking Senses: Cross-Modality in Perceptual Domains across Cultures"*

### Code is run in R
The following libraries are essential to running the algorithms
* library(tidyverse)
* library(tidytext) 
* library(topicmodels) 
* library(tm)
* library(SnowballC) 
* library(dplyr)
* library(ggplot2)
* library(dplyr)
* library(stringr)
* library(sqldf)
* library(tidyr)
* library(udpipe)

###Running the code:
1. Mexican Cusisines (_mex-cuisines-algorithm.R_)
2. American Cusisines (_usa-cuisines-algorithm.R_) 

The called function (i.e. the last line of code) is where the magic happens
```
top_terms_by_topic_LDA(c_l_ean_POS$lemma, number_of_topics = 5, plottitle = "Top Adjectives associated with Salads in Mexican Cuisines")  
#lemma topics plot
```
